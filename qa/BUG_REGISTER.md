## BUG-003 reproduction

Preconditions:
- v1.4.13 authorized;
- install v1.4.14 over it without uninstall.

1. Launch v1.4.14.
2. Do not press Step 2.
3. Wait for automatic session recovery.

Actual:
- Step 2 remains red.

Expected:
- previously granted account/session should recover automatically when Google permits it.

Retest result:
- successful in-place update phone test completed on v1.4.20;
- Step 2 briefly showed gray while silent recovery ran;
- Step 2 automatically returned to green without manual re-authorization;
- BUG-003 is closed for this recovery scenario.

## Per-release rule

Every release from v1.4.15 onward contains a snapshot of this register under:
`docs/v.X.Y.Z/qa/BUG_REGISTER.md`.

## BUG-004 reproduction

Actual:
- Step 2 can still display green `Google / YTM ✓`;
- API reports that Google authorization is no longer valid;
- user must authorize again.

Expected:
- HTTP 401 invalidates the in-memory ready state;
- Step 2 immediately stops showing green/ready;
- imported playlist and search selections remain intact.

v1.4.17 adds HTTP 401 invalidation.
Status remains RETEST until verified on the phone.
