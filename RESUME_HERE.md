Last updated: **2026-10-07**

## Live resume point

- Repository: `faric-ua/YTM`
- Release: **v1.4.55 / Phase B — Type-aware file library (#54)**
- Branch: `feat/v1.4.55-ux-hardening`
- Phase A and Phase B #41/#25/#57/#55 are PHONE PASS / CLOSED.
- #53 candidate is implemented, validated and signed:
  - implementation checkpoint `7c21b0e50ef6e380c408302d3b493ea94895969f`, Validate `37257583900 — SUCCESS`;
  - final candidate HEAD `efab5dc15ce389aa50e5d9d15aa1cdd78e60e08f`;
  - exact-HEAD Validate Android `37257995437 — SUCCESS`;
  - signed build `37338681198 — SUCCESS` from that exact HEAD;
  - release preflight/JVM/build gates PASS;
  - MainActivity remains under cleanup budget at 4089 lines.
- Implemented #53 contract:
  - pure read-only aggregation over BulkSyncSessionStore, PendingJobStore and relevant History;
  - ACTION_REQUIRED vs WARNING classification; normal completed work excluded;
  - stable identity dedupe only, never title matching;
  - exact routes to Bulk Session, Pending job detail and History detail;
  - Recovery Center is read-only on open/recreate/back;
  - compact Home `⚠ N` badge only when actionable work exists;
  - subtle breathing respects disabled system animators and stops after the current count is opened/acknowledged;
  - Menu shows the same `Потребує уваги: N` count.
- No Search/write/rollback/restore/delete execution semantics were moved into Recovery Center.
- #53 final phone result: **PHONE PASS / CLOSED**. Home/list/rotation/Back/Menu, exact Pending/History/Bulk routes, no-auto-start and acknowledgement stop all passed.
- Phone QA partial PASS: Home displays `⚠ 2`; Recovery Center opens with two actionable items and a separate warning section; opening the center did not visibly auto-start recovery work; portrait → landscape → portrait while scrolled mid-list preserved the same logical Recovery Center area without visible auto-start; Back returned to normal Home with `⚠ 2`; Menu shows `Центр відновлення — Потребує уваги: 2`.

## CRASH CHECKPOINT — 2026-10-06

If the chat/session is lost, resume **here**, not from older checkpoints.

Closed baseline:
- #53 / Unified Recovery Center — **PHONE PASS / CLOSED**;
- do not repeat the #53 phone matrix.

Active task:
- #54 / UX-049 Type-aware YTM file library and scoped import/restore chooser.

#54 verified source state:
- inventory + content-first file-library contract complete;
- pure `YtmArtifactClassifier` + `YtmArtifactScopePolicy` implemented;
- Full Restore requests only `FULL_LOCAL_RESTORE` candidates;
- History Import requests only `HISTORY_RESTORE` candidates;
- explicit `Інший файл…` fallback remains available;
- existing `LocalBackupManager.inspectBackup()` and `HistoryStore.inspectImportJson()` remain authoritative before mutation.

First scoped-chooser signed phone slice:
- app source `bddebe7adb7a95c4bed88088cb5496fe92100614`;
- exact-HEAD Validate Android `37398594246 — SUCCESS`;
- signed build `37405310918 — SUCCESS`;
- user installed that signed APK;
- Full Restore chooser PHONE PARTIAL PASS: after classification it showed `Файли потрібного типу: 9`, Full Backup cards, and explicit `Інший файл…`;
- no Restore was intentionally started during this chooser check.

Phone finding found on that signed slice:
- portrait → landscape caused a long return to `Перевіряю типи JSON-файлів…` / `Перевіряю вміст JSON-файлів…`;
- a visible Full Backup candidate is ~25.3 MB;
- source cause was confirmed: Activity recreation cleared visible candidates and reread/reparsed every JSON file.

Corrective rotation-cache source:
- corrective app-source `daaa599da7c031c0df881b7fbd8b280f218d3913`; later checkpoint commits are documentation-only;
- bounded process-local artifact classification cache keyed by `URI + lastModified + size`;
- unchanged classified files can be reused after Activity recreation;
- changed/new files still classify off the UI thread;
- interrupted reads are not cached;
- cache remains read-only UX state and does not bypass final owner validation;
- exact-HEAD Validate Android `37407395790 — SUCCESS`;
- release preflight PASS;
- JVM tests PASS, including cache tests;
- unsigned release assemble PASS.

**Phone result:** Full Restore rotation-cache behavior is **PHONE PASS 2026-10-06**. History-only scoped chooser is **PHONE PASS 2026-10-07**: `Вибрати History JSON` showed `Файли потрібного типу: 6`, matching History JSON candidates and `Інший файл…`; portrait → landscape → portrait returned the scoped cards near-immediately and no History import auto-started. #54 remains OPEN for Playlist Project scoping, typed cards and wrong-type messaging.

## NEXT ACTION — do this first

1. Source implementation for Playlist Project scoping / typed cards / wrong-type messaging is validated at `b53a73ed6be46c932c7a21c0a314b3788fdb9931`; Validate `37536534440 — SUCCESS` passed release preflight, JVM tests and unsigned release assemble.
2. On the phone open YTM Importer Menu and run `1 — Sync YTM`.
3. Then run `6 — Validate + Build signed APK`. The menu script must accept only the exact current remote HEAD after its Validate succeeds and then dispatch/watch the signed build.
4. After BUILD PASS: `3 — Download signed APK` → `4 — Open APK folder` → tap the downloaded v1.4.55 release APK and install it over the current app.
5. Remaining PHONE acceptance:
   - **«Імпорт» → «Імпорт із файлу» → «CSV, TXT або YTM Project» → «Вибрати файл»**;
   - verify CSV/TXT remain available and JSON cards are YTM Project only;
   - verify readable type/metadata on cards and **«Інший файл…»**;
   - rotate portrait → landscape → portrait with no auto-import;
   - through **«Інший файл…»**, choose a known History JSON and require **«Файл не підходить»** with a clear detected/expected type message and no import.
6. Do not repeat the already accepted Full Restore / History chooser phone slices.
7. Do not mark #54 CLOSED until this remaining phone acceptance passes.

## Consolidated phone matrix

The candidate must cover Home/Menu, Bulk Preview/Session, History list/detail, Queue,
Data/file chooser, long Help/destructive confirmation, portrait/landscape and both
rotations, Neon plus Blue/Green, scroll/selectable-text retention, Back/Cancel/Close,
and no automatic Search/write/rollback/delete/restore/save.

## Mandatory recovery order

1. `RESUME_HERE.md`.
2. Verify live branch HEAD + latest Actions.
3. `ACTIVE_PLAN.md` — first unchecked CURRENT TASK item must match this file.
4. `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`.
5. Relevant current-task contract/audit/source files.
6. Continue work.

**Do not use old sleep checkpoints as a resume point.**

## Update rule

After every verified progress step that changes the resume point:
- update `RESUME_HERE.md`;
- update `ACTIVE_PLAN.md`;
- update `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md` when materially changed;
- keep generated artifacts synchronized;
- never mark phone PASS from code/static/CI alone.
