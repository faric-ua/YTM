# YTM Importer — RESUME HERE

## User-facing answer format — mandatory

Before project progress/phone handoff responses, read
`docs/assistant-kit/USER_RESPONSE_TEMPLATE.md`. Keep the agreed order:
**short fix heading → concise findings/result → final Termux menu steps →
last paragraph: short APK phone test**. Give exact user-visible menu labels,
provide ready test inputs, no repetitive completed QA. For long YTM work,
use three visible parts; do not move Termux/phone QA above the final section.

## Live resume point

- Repository: `faric-ua/YTM`
- Release: **v1.4.55 / Phase C — #58 CLOSED, next #27/#28 Bulk preparation UX**
- Branch: `feat/v1.4.55-ux-hardening`
- Phase A and Phase B #41/#25/#57/#55/#53/#54 are PHONE PASS / CLOSED.
- #53 candidate is implemented, validated and signed:
  - implementation checkpoint `7c21b0e50ef6e380c408302d3b493ea94895969f`, Validate `37257583900 — SUCCESS`;
  - final candidate HEAD `efab5dc15ce389aa50e5d9d15aa1cdd78e60e08f`;
  - exact-HEAD Validate Android `37257995437 — SUCCESS`;
  - signed build `37338681198 — SUCCESS` from that exact HEAD;
  - release preflight/JVM/build gates PASS;
  - MainActivity remains under cleanup budget at 4089 lines.
- Implemented #53 contract:
  - pure read-only aggregation over BulkSyncSessionStore, PendingJobStore and relevant History;
  - ACTION_REQUIRED vs WARNING classification; normal completed work excluded;
  - stable identity dedupe only, never title matching;
  - exact routes to Bulk Session, Pending job detail and History detail;
  - Recovery Center is read-only on open/recreate/back;
  - compact Home `⚠ N` badge only when actionable work exists;
  - subtle breathing respects disabled system animators and stops after the current count is opened/acknowledged;
  - Menu shows the same `Потребує уваги: N` count.
- No Search/write/rollback/restore/delete execution semantics were moved into Recovery Center.
- #53 final phone result: **PHONE PASS / CLOSED**. Home/list/rotation/Back/Menu, exact Pending/History/Bulk routes, no-auto-start and acknowledgement stop all passed.
- Phone QA partial PASS: Home displays `⚠ 2`; Recovery Center opens with two actionable items and a separate warning section; opening the center did not visibly auto-start recovery work; portrait → landscape → portrait while scrolled mid-list preserved the same logical Recovery Center area without visible auto-start; Back returned to normal Home with `⚠ 2`; Menu shows `Центр відновлення — Потребує уваги: 2`.

## CRASH CHECKPOINT — 2026-10-06

If the chat/session is lost, resume **here**, not from older checkpoints.

Closed baseline:
- #53 / Unified Recovery Center — **PHONE PASS / CLOSED**;
- do not repeat the #53 phone matrix.

Closed task:
- #54 / UX-049 Type-aware YTM file library and scoped import/restore chooser — **PHONE PASS / CLOSED 2026-10-07**.

Closed task:
- #52 / UX-047 Simplify Termux menu for non-developer phone use — **PHONE PASS / CLOSED 2026-10-07**.

Closed task:
- #30 / UX-036 Dedicated local playlist Edit — **PHONE ACCEPTED / CLOSED 2026-10-08**. Full earlier linked-YTM/remote-safety baseline carried forward; no repeat without protected-owner change. Active task: #29 / UX-035 Blank URL validation.

#54 verified source state:
- inventory + content-first file-library contract complete;
- pure `YtmArtifactClassifier` + `YtmArtifactScopePolicy` implemented;
- Full Restore requests only `FULL_LOCAL_RESTORE` candidates;
- History Import requests only `HISTORY_RESTORE` candidates;
- explicit `Інший файл…` fallback remains available;
- existing `LocalBackupManager.inspectBackup()` and `HistoryStore.inspectImportJson()` remain authoritative before mutation.

First scoped-chooser signed phone slice:
- app source `bddebe7adb7a95c4bed88088cb5496fe92100614`;
- exact-HEAD Validate Android `37398594246 — SUCCESS`;
- signed build `37405310918 — SUCCESS`;
- user installed that signed APK;
- Full Restore chooser PHONE PARTIAL PASS: after classification it showed `Файли потрібного типу: 9`, Full Backup cards, and explicit `Інший файл…`;
- no Restore was intentionally started during this chooser check.

Phone finding found on that signed slice:
- portrait → landscape caused a long return to `Перевіряю типи JSON-файлів…` / `Перевіряю вміст JSON-файлів…`;
- a visible Full Backup candidate is ~25.3 MB;
- source cause was confirmed: Activity recreation cleared visible candidates and reread/reparsed every JSON file.

Corrective rotation-cache source:
- corrective app-source `daaa599da7c031c0df881b7fbd8b280f218d3913`; later checkpoint commits are documentation-only;
- bounded process-local artifact classification cache keyed by `URI + lastModified + size`;
- unchanged classified files can be reused after Activity recreation;
- changed/new files still classify off the UI thread;
- interrupted reads are not cached;
- cache remains read-only UX state and does not bypass final owner validation;
- exact-HEAD Validate Android `37407395790 — SUCCESS`;
- release preflight PASS;
- JVM tests PASS, including cache tests;
- unsigned release assemble PASS.

**Phone result:** #54 is **PHONE PASS / CLOSED 2026-10-07**. Full Restore and History scoped chooser/rotation passed; Playlist Project `Імпорт файла` showed typed CSV/TXT/YTM Project cards, wrong-type History JSON was blocked with a clear message, and portrait → landscape → portrait returned the scoped/typed list near-immediately without auto-import.

## NEXT ACTION — do this first

**#58 / manual-only Review filter and landscape viewport — PHONE ACCEPTED / CLOSED 2026-10-08.** No repeat of accepted tests. Signed candidate exact app/docs HEAD `b8222fc24264edf6ece3cf1cc30ea4aa3dbca4b4`, Validate Android `37826627416 — SUCCESS`, signed APK `37839577073 — SUCCESS`. User initially `1+ 2+ 3+` for manual filter/count, `≡ Усі` restoring 41, rotation state. A real-phone landscape screenshot showed missing scroll; corrective moved Review controls into the scrollable ListView header with safe track click mapping. User subsequently answered `+` to the **single new landscape scroll/Mezziah-track-tap phone test**. This latter acceptance is user-reported (no new screenshot), not falsely claimed as screenshot-verified. GitHub #58 CLOSED.

**#29, #30, #40 remain PHONE ACCEPTED / CLOSED** with historical evidence retained. Do not rerun #58/#40/#29/#30 unless a protected owner changes or new evidence contradicts acceptance.

**NEXT ACTIVE TASK: #27 and #28 — Bulk session preparation UI and stale status after closing the session.** Both issues are OPEN; next action is **read their exact contracts/source, reconcile scope, prepare a focused source/phone plan**. No Bulk API, write, checkpoint, ledger, Queue or remote mutation may run automatically. No new Android changes or APK requested yet.

**Formatting rule:** first read `docs/assistant-kit/USER_RESPONSE_TEMPLATE.md`; short fix heading → concise outcome → final Termux instructions → last tiny new APK test. The #58 closeout is documentation-only; no APK rebuild is warranted merely to mark this pass.

## Consolidated phone matrix

**Scope phone QA to the exact changed owner and its lifecycle/interaction contract.**
The full historical screen matrix is a reference for broad shared changes, not a
mandatory repeat for unrelated presentation-only fixes. For #40, test the
manual URL field, manual-choice visual hierarchy, rotation, Back/Cancel,
and no auto-lookup. Do not rerun accepted #29/#30 screens.

## Mandatory recovery order

1. `RESUME_HERE.md`.
2. Verify live branch HEAD + latest Actions.
3. `ACTIVE_PLAN.md` — first unchecked CURRENT TASK item must match this file.
4. `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`.
5. Relevant current-task contract/audit/source files.
6. Continue work.

**Do not use old sleep checkpoints as a resume point.**

## Update rule

After every verified progress step that changes the resume point:
- update `RESUME_HERE.md`;
- update `ACTIVE_PLAN.md`;
- update `CURRENT_HANDOFF.md` when materially changed;
- keep generated artifacts synchronized;
- never mark phone PASS from code/static/CI alone.
