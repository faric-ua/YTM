# YTM Importer — Roadmap

## Current
v1.4.16 — Cleanup Wave 5 / DestinationCoordinator

## Known
- BUG-001/Q-001 OPEN
- BUG-002/Q-002 DEFERRED
- BUG-003/Q-003 auth recovery FAIL — DEFERRED FOR LATER FIX
- BUG-004/Q-004 stale green authorization state — DEFERRED TO AUTH FIX WAVE

## v1.4.16
- [x] extract DestinationCoordinator
- [x] destination playlist cache/selection extraction
- [x] duplicate scan + quota accounting extraction
- [x] duplicate write-plan extraction
- [x] destination coordinator audit
- [x] per-release docs/diagrams/QA snapshot
- [x] GitHub build
- [x] phone test: new private playlist
- [x] phone test: existing playlist selection
- [x] phone test: duplicate scan
- [x] phone test: skip duplicates
- [x] phone test: G-07 Add duplicates anyway
- [x] phone test: result modal
- [x] record BUG-004 stale green authorization indicator
- [ ] phone test: NO_SCAN fallback
- [ ] phone test: destination rotation smoke
- [ ] finish v1.4.16 release test status

## UI/UX follow-up observations
- Search plan dialog still uses older plain text action buttons; consider UiChrome action hierarchy.
- Result modal should show skipped-duplicate count, especially when `Додано: 0`.
- Consider localizing developer terms in Destination UI (`playlistItems.list`, `request(s)`, `playlist`), while retaining technical details in diagnostics.
- Current button/card corner styling is unchanged; any corner-radius redesign should be a dedicated UI cleanup item.

## Next
Preferred v1.4.17:
continue MainActivity cleanup only after v1.4.16 phone regression confirms no destination behavior regression.

## Later bug-fix wave
Fix every FAIL/BLOCKED case accumulated in BUG_REGISTER and release test runs,
including:
- BUG-003/Q-003 silent Google/YTM recovery after in-place update;
- BUG-004/Q-004 stale green connected indicator after authorization becomes invalid.
